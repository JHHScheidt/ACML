To run the program with our implemented Q-Learner.
Run the file named MountainCarWindow.java

The episode count can be adjusted in the first for loop within the main method.
When this program completes it will give you three plots.
Two heatmaps and 1 line plot.
The first heatmap plot will be the position vs velocity with heat action.
The second heatmap plot will be the position vs velocity with heat Qvalues.
While the last plot will put episode count vs timestep
These three plots can be turned of by commenting out the Plot calls at 
the end of the while loop.
